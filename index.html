                        I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are,
                        and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home
                        every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.

                        I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a
                        glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually
                        have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or
                        stress in the morning

                        I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that
                        I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any
                        enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal
                        with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I
                        wouldn't lose to anyone.

                        <characterDescription>
                            Yoshihiro Kira is a ghost, having the appearance of a lightly-built, balding old man.
                            Yoshihiro has a small mustache and a goatee of dark hair. While he was human, Yoshihiro
                            is shown to have fancied modest, respectable attire; consisting of a striped green
                            button-down shirt with a purple tie, yellow cardigan, and a loose-fitting lime-green suit.
                            As a ghost, however, Yoshihiro now only wears his striped green shirt with matching pants.
                            He is extremely devoted to his son and takes supporting him and his ambitions to the
                            extreme, even going as far as to protect his son's serial killer lifestyle. There is
                            evidence that his son Yoshikage inherited his malignant soul from him, as Yoshihiro utterly
                            disregards the women his son has killed from his youth and the fact that Enya and DIO saw
                            fit to entrust him with the Bow and Arrow.

                        <characterDescription>
                            Shinobu is a woman of seemingly average height and slim build, with hair that is parted to
                            the right and tied back in a low ponytail. Sometimes, like in her first appearance, she will
                            tie back several locks of hair that are part of her bangs. She wears several different
                            outfits throughout the series, most of them having skirts and patterns such as polka-dots.
                            Shinobu has a personality closer to that of a younger woman than a responsible mother,
                            detesting her marriage. While she felt no hatred towards Kosaku, her relationship with him
                            was cold and full of regret. She wished for more excitement in her life and often lashed out
                            at her husband and son out of frustration. Though she resents her son for trapping her in
                            her marriage, she occasionally reaches out to him, only to be ignored. She is very pleased
                            when he finally begins to return her affection.

                        <characterDescription>
                            Hayato is a young 11-year old child with a rather scrawny build and straight brown hair that
                            reaches just past his chin. Hayato is a quiet boy who spends most of his time in his bedroom.
                            He rarely speaks to his parents, preferring to spy on them with electronic devices he has
                            planted in their room. According to his mother, he has no close friends.
                            However, when pressed into a corner, Hayato proves to be exceptionally brave. He was willing
                            to commit suicide if it would prevent Bites the Dust from activating. Even Josuke comments
                            on Hayato's bravery for his age when he volunteers to set off Okuyasu's explosively-charged
                            body at the risk of death. Despite having a somewhat strained relationship with his mother,
                            he ultimately loves her and his desire to defeat Kira comes from a desire to protect his
                            mother and the town.

                            Tama is stubborn, sticking to its territory in the cellar when Shinobu Kawajiri attempts to
                            chase it out. After it is killed, it shows a desire for revenge and attacks Shinobu when it
                            sees her in the garden. It is friendly toward Kira until Kira himself deems the newly
                            resurrected Stray Cat a threat. However, it is able to easily forgive Kira, and allies
                            itself with him. Tama is shown to get along well with Okuyasu's father after Kira's death.
                            ama was once a normal cat that was hit with an Arrow while peacefully lazing about by a tree.
                            It takes refuge in the cellar of the Kawajiri household where it is killed by a broken glass
                            bottle when Shinobu Kawajiri tries to chase it out. After being buried in their garden, its
                            dormant Stand ability brings it back to life as a cat-like plant named Stray Cat.
